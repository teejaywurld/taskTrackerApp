# This is a task tracker application with database built with React JS 

where "a task can be added", "a reminder can be set" and also, "tasks/reminders can be deleted"

I learnt about the core concepts and fundamentals of react looking at components, states, and hooks not leaving out routing.

I understood UI Components better as a bunch of separate components and that Components can have "state" which is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves.

I understood as well that "App" or "global" state refers to state that is available to the entire UI and not just a single component.

I understood as well that React Hooks are functions that let its "hook" into the React state and lifecycle features from function components.
